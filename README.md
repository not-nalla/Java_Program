## Parameterized Constructor in Java

A **parameterized constructor** is a special type of constructor that allows you to create objects with specific initial values. Unlike the default constructor (which has no parameters), a parameterized constructor lets you pass arguments when creating an object, making your code more flexible and readable.

### Key Features:
- Initializes object properties at the time of creation.
- Can have multiple parameters.
- Supports constructor overloading (more than one constructor with different parameter lists).
- Reduces the need for extra setter methods.
- Helps prevent uninitialized object states.
