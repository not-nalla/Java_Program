## Parameterized Constructor in Java

A **parameterized constructor** is a special type of constructor that allows you to create objects with specific initial values. Unlike the default constructor (which has no parameters), a parameterized constructor lets you pass arguments when creating an object, making your code more flexible and readable.

### Key Features:
- Initializes object properties at the time of creation.
- Can have multiple parameters.
- Supports constructor overloading (more than one constructor with different parameter lists).
- Reduces the need for extra setter methods.
- Helps prevent uninitialized object states.

## Multilevel Inheritance in Java

Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance where a class is derived
from another class, which is also derived from another class.

##Structure:
    Class A (Parent)
        ↓
    Class B (Child of A)
        ↓
    Class C (Child of B)

## Key Points:
- Achieved using the 'extends' keyword
- Supports code reusability
- Child class can access methods and properties of all its parent classes
- Java allows multilevel inheritance but does not support multiple inheritance with classes
